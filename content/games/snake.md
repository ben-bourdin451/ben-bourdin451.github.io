This is a game that I built as a quick demo of how easy it is to make games using HTML & JS for a kids computing club [Wizzie-wizzie](https://www.wizziewizzie.org/).
I initially made this game in a couple of hours using jsfiddle, it literally requires no setup and can be done on any hardware simply using the browser.
