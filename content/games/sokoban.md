Try beating all 51 levels in `45min or less`.

Finish each level by putting all the boxes in the right place.

Very old game that was built originally in C when I was 14 as an exercise for an [online tutorial](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/19980-apprenez-a-programmer-en-c/18709-tp-mario-sokoban). I rebuilt it in JS a few years later and it now uses webpack & an HTML canvas for simplicity.
